# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: a parameter is the part of a function that will be a placeholder for the argument. The parameter represents a datatype, but does not contain any data itself. The argument replaces the parameter when the function is called, and can be a variable or direct datatype.

  Researched answer:
shorter version of above:

Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.

Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: value, index, and array. Value is required. index and array are optional.

  Researched answer: ". Each return value that the function creates will be the elements for the new array." This illustrates why the value paramater is required. .map() will return an array of the same length.




3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: object destructuring is a concise way to assign all desired keys of an object as separate variables.

  Researched answer:
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Methods are functions that are built into the language. Functions are created by the developer to encapulate code that will take in data and provide a desired return. Functions are useful because they can be called repeatedly and with different input/output

  Researched answer: a method is a set of instructions associated with an object.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class is a template with a set of instructions on how to create certain objects.

  Objects are containers for datatypes in javascript with key: value pairs. (an array is also technically an object)

  Researched answer:
"Class is a user-defined datatype that has its own data members and member functions whereas an object is an instance of class by which we can access the data members and member functions of the class."


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is when a function or variable is called and the code is again read from the top of the page

  Researched answer:
"Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top"


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

2. React:

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

3. React state:

State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation.
It’s managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function). The difference is while a “normal” variable “disappears” when their function exits, the state variables are preserved by React.

4. React lifecycle methods:

Lifecycle methods are special methods built-in to React, used to operate on components throughout their duration in the DOM.

5. DOM:

DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web-app. DOM represents the entire UI of your application. The DOM is represented as a tree data structure.
